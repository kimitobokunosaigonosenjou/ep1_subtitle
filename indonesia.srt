1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,580
Kekuatan astral, energi aneh 
yang tertidur di dalam planet ini.

2
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,540
Kekuatannya terlalu kuat untuk kemanusiaan.

3
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,200
Mereka yang memiliki kekuatan astral 
ditakuti sebagai penyihir atau penyihir,

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,080
dan ditindas ... oleh orang-orang di Kekaisaran.

5
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,700
Tempat di mana banyak orang telah dirugikan 
oleh kekuatan astral - Kekaisaran.

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,450
Surga yang tersisa untuk para penyihir tak 
berdosa-- Kedaulatan Nebulis.

7
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,160
Nasib yang membawa 
kedua negara ini ke titik ini ...

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,910
... adalah jalan yang tidak pernah berakhir melalui perang.

9
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,580
Aku akan mengakhiri perang ini.

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,660
Saya akan membangun dunia tanpa penganiayaan.

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,080
Sehingga,

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,120
perang salib yang akan mengubah 
dunia kita telah dimulai.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,950
Perang Salib Terakhir atau Bangkitnya Dunia Baru

14
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,840
Satu tahun sebelumnya

15
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:45,250
Ban lengan Anda ... Anda seorang Saint Disciple?

16
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,790
Mengapa seorang Saint Disciple ...?

17
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,540
Quickly. We have to run.

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,660
Here. It's not much, but...

19
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,250
Now, go on.

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,200
Raise your head.

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Prisoner Iska, age 16.

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,830
You were the youngest in history to be
granted the title of the Saint Disciple.

23
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:42,160
However, a year ago, you were sentenced
for breaking out an imprisoned witch.

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,910
This led to your demotion
as the Saint Disciple.

25
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,870
Is this correct?

26
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,700
Yes.

27
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,200
As of today, you are released.

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,790
Considering our nation has been at war
with the witches for 100 years,

29
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,080
your action is of a great crime.

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,700
However, we are providing you
with an opportunity to make amends.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,500
You are given a mission. Our longtime enemies
now call themselves astral mages.

32
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,950
You will be taking down a witch.

33
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,160
Not just any witch.

34
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,830
She is "purebred," the direct descendant
of the Grand Witch Nebulis.

35
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,540
In the past, the Grand Witch Nebulis
has turned our Empire into a sea of flames.

36
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,410
Those descendants are called "purebreds,"

37
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,950
and as you know, harbor great astral power.

38
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,160
Yes, I have been in many battles with them.

39
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,080
Your target is one of the most powerful.
The "Ice Calamity Witch."

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
The Ice Calamity Witch...

41
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,410
Successor of the Black Steel, Iska.

42
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,580
From this moment forward, you are free.

43
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,500
We will provide you with a transit vehicle
to the frontlines in 17 hours.

44
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,410
Anything you need, we will provide.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,080
There are three members
I would like on my unit.

46
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,850
"Powder Base"

47
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,700
Nene, where should we sit?

48
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,410
Nene, we haven't gotten the food we ordered yet.

49
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,870
Nene!

50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,040
Okay, okay!

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,950
I'm coming!

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,910
Come on in!

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,580
Jhin?!

54
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,750
I'm glad you're here!
Did you come to see me?

55
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,870
We just saw each other not long ago.

56
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,330
He's been discharged. He's back
at the dorm, hurrying to get ready.

57
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,370
Wait, you're not saying...?

58
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,790
We depart tomorrow morning at zero hour.

59
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,660
We're heading for the front in a transport.

60
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,700
A transport? The front?

61
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,540
It was the same as the morning sun,

62
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,660
but it's been a year since I've seen
the stars in the sky like this, too.

63
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,000
It's four minutes and 30 seconds to muster.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,910
Jhin! Thanks for your help contacting
everyone this afternoon.

65
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,700
I'm used to your short notice.

66
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,450
Iska, congrats on your release!

67
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:35,450
Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!

68
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,450
Nene, you don't have to jump for joy.

69
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,500
Ah, looks like the captain is here!

70
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,750
Hey, Captain!

71
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,700
G-G-Guys!

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,250
I'm sorry I'm late!

73
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,790
Ah, she fell down.

74
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,660
Same old Captain.

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,080
Ah, it's Iska!

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,450
It's been an awfully long time.
You've grown a little taller, haven't you?

77
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,200
--She's just going to ignore falling down...
--Have I?

78
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,290
I guess a girl like me is no match
when it comes to growing tall.

79
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,700
What do you mean, "girl"?
You're well past that age.

80
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,080
Wh-What are you talking about, Jhin?!
I'm still 22!

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,870
Still, I'm delighted.

82
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,540
Iska is ever the nice, sweet boy,

83
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,160
while Nene has grown
even more cute and pretty.

84
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,410
And today, at least, Jhin's sharp tongue
brings back good memories.

85
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,790
Hey, hold on...

86
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,500
Anyhow, Special Defense for Humankind
Third Division, Unit N07,

87
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,000
is back together for the first time in a year!

88
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,910
All right, off we go!

89
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,250
Okay then, what kind of mission is this?

90
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,450
Witch suppression.
That's all our unit ever does, right?

91
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,290
What's more, our target on this one

92
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,950
is a direct descendant
of the Grand Witch Nebulis--a purebred.

93
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,540
A purebred?!

94
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,500
Boss, you've heard of
the Ice Calamity Witch, right?

95
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,830
The Ice Calamity Witch?!

96
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,080
I-Iska, is this true?

97
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,500
Yes. Apparently, the reason I was released

98
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
was so we could capture this astral mage.

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,290
Oh, man. Iska, you've been set up
by the Eight Great Apostles.

100
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,160
How do you mean?

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,660
She first appeared on the northern front
in Yubel, I believe.

102
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,700
I hear she broke through the line
and made it back all by herself.

103
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,450
In light of her military record since then,

104
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,790
some people say that she's the most
powerful astral mage in history.

105
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,700
Yeah. But she doesn't know about
our soldier, Iska, either.

106
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,450
For better or worse, the Nebulis Sovereignty
has no intel on you either.

107
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,540
In their view, you are someone
completely unexpected.

108
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,040
That's right! Iska was imprisoned
right after he became a Saint Disciple.

109
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,000
Right. Which means...

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
...their guard will be down?

111
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,160
That's what the bigwigs are probably thinking.

112
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,200
That being said, they're turning to you now
after throwing you in prison,

113
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,790
so even they must be at
a complete loss as to what to do.

114
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,080
The Ice Calamity Witch, huh?

115
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,580
Iska, are you really going
to carry out this mission?

116
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,120
Of course. This is my big chance, after all.

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,750
If you fail this mission, you'll be...

118
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,950
I'm trying not to think about that.

119
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,370
I'd like to put a stop to this hopeless war.

120
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,450
That's all I've thought about, both now...

121
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,790
...and a year ago.

122
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,080
This weapons reactor is brand new, isn't it?

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,700
I believe so.

124
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,080
I wonder why.

125
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,950
They have such a large reactor,
but so few troops deployed here.

126
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,750
--Ah, that's likely--
--I'm back!

127
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,620
Whoa, you startled me.
Nene, don't surprise me like that.

128
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm all finished checking the transport back in.

129
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,540
I also spotted the commanding officer
in that tent over there.

130
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,040
Word is that this reactor isn't yet finished.

131
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,160
Since there have been a lot of
astral mages strikes lately,

132
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,080
their manpower is busy defending
the front instead of finishing up here.

133
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,700
I figured. That's the reason why
there are so few people here, too.

134
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,370
I thought it was strange. It's shuddering
too much while it's running,

135
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,040
and there's a lot of rumble
in its operating hum.

136
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,580
Wow, that's our Nene for you!
Such a first-rate engineer!

137
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,250
Also, check out the color and smell
of the steam from the exhaust vent!

138
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,290
The pressure unit is running,

139
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,410
but the control ring is just about
at its threshold--

140
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,410
It's a vicious cycle.

141
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,750
The Empire builds a reactor.

142
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,790
Then the Sovereignty launches
a strike to destroy it.

143
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,580
So we build more weapons.

144
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,450
After repeating the cycle for a hundred years,
this is the world we have.

145
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,500
That's what Master would always regurgitate.

146
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,580
Whatever triggered this war,

147
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,870
the reasons that keep dragging it on
now are emotionally charged.

148
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,500
After coming this far, logic won't stop it.

149
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,410
Not unless someone forcibly puts an end to it,
even if it means being hated.

150
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,830
Puts an end to it, huh?

151
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,580
The peace talks that a certain someone
is thinking is one option--

152
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,870
whether it would work or not
is a separate matter.

153
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, acknowledged.

154
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,330
What is it?

155
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,910
That was a unit at the front.

156
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,040
They said they aren't engaging
any astral power forces at the moment.

157
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,160
They're expecting our rendezvous.

158
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,250
Nene, d-drive more safely!

159
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,200
It's all right, it's all right.

160
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,910
I could drive one of these
with one eye closed, no problem.

161
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,580
I'm begging you, please keep your eyes open!

162
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,450
Jump!

163
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,330
Captain, hold on to me!

164
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,120
Was that a Nebulis astral power force?

165
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,040
No way! This is still Imperial territory!

166
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,370
They broke through our front-line defenses.

167
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,620
There's probably a powerful astral mage around.

168
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,870
Incoming message.

169
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,120
It's a general request for backup from
the Nelka force communications team.

170
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,410
No time to waste, is there?
We still have our sneak attack,

171
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,410
but there's a battalion of astral mages
closing in at a furious pace.

172
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,700
Jhin, behind you!

173
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,620
He just cut through astral power flames?

174
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,700
T-Two astral mages! Everyone, watch yourselves!

175
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
We know. And don't shout out orders like that.

176
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,410
They'll know in a second who the boss is.

177
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,040
Just worry about yourself instead.

178
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,370
I don't need your backtalk, either!

179
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,830
Then stand back.

180
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Wind astral mages.

181
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,250
When did they...?!

182
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,250
I guess there's no presence to detect
when they burrow underground.

183
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,120
That's a large-scale spell.
They have a fairly powerful astral mage.

184
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,500
How can you two be so calm?!

185
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,870
Because we anticipated
something like this happening.

186
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,750
Iska, can you cut through them all?

187
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,500
Once I get my intuition back.
Right now, it would be a bit difficult.

188
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Which means,

189
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,290
I'll need to ask for your help, Nene.

190
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,410
Roger that!

191
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,750
Anti-astral-power flares... deploy!

192
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,580
You take the right.

193
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,250
Astral power of raging inferno...!

194
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,120
Burst forth!

195
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,830
You jumped out of range?

196
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,040
There's no way you could do that!

197
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,500
That's what the training I underwent was for.

198
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,700
Jhin, how are you coming along?

199
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,790
All done.

200
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,830
Amazing. Jhin and Iska,
you never fail to impress.

201
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,540
A year ago, we might've left everything
to Iska and gone on ahead without him.

202
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,330
You're an anti-war berserker, was it?

203
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,330
Earth astral power?

204
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,000
A golem. And one that can
generate quickly, too.

205
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,500
How peculiar. You dealt with that unit
before I even arrived?

206
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,040
By all appearances,
you're just an ordinary squad.

207
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,120
Come to life.

208
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,700
Captain, I'll take care of this.

209
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,290
Please take Jhin and Nene
and go offer some support.

210
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,410
Huh? But...

211
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,870
We'll spend just as much time
with all four of us being here.

212
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,370
All right. Be careful!

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,750
It regenerated?

214
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,330
You sliced through my astral arts?
Are you a Saint Disciple?!

215
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,750
I have no intention of answering that.

216
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:37,160
But I will if you tell me where the astral
mage called the Ice Calamity Witch is.

217
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,290
Silence, you grunt! I will not allow you
to even look upon her!

218
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,540
I suppose you wouldn't. But I have business
with the Ice Calamity Witch!

219
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,080
You can forget it!

220
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,700
Too slow.

221
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,870
Who the hell are you?

222
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,750
Where is the Ice Calamity Witch?

223
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:06,700
Kill me. We astral mages will
have nothing to do with Imperial dogs.

224
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,950
We're prepared to choose death
rather than become your prisoners.

225
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,200
Did you think threatening me
with your sword would rattle me?

226
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,080
I'm up for close-quarters combat, too.

227
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,250
Away with you!

228
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,200
I-Impossible...

229
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,200
Lady Alice...

230
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Alice? Don't tell me you're
the Ice Calamity...

231
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,370
Yes.

232
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,160
That is my name.

233
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,040
Let me prove it. You can experience it yourself.

234
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,120
Great Ice Calamity.

235
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Rin, are you all right?

236
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,620
Lady Alice.

237
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,080
You're joking...

238
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,700
Please be careful.

239
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,660
That man's sword can slice through
and block astral arts.

240
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,500
Thank you, Rin. You did well to stall him.

241
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,620
Stall?

242
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,540
The reactor!

243
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,120
Shatter away.

244
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,910
So this was your plan all along?

245
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,290
Who are you?

246
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,410
How could someone who's not
a Saint Disciple overpower Rin?

247
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,620
I'm here to capture you.

248
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,870
Who do you think you're talking to?

249
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,950
If you don't want to feel an icy pain
that is far worse than death, then...

250
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,580
Surrender.

251
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,000
Swordsman of the Empire, what is your name?

252
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,250
Iska. And yours?

253
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,910
Aliceliese Lou Nebulis IX.

254
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,950
And you already know

255
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,500
that I am the astral mage you Imperials
call the "Ice Calamity Witch."

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,910
Walls, crush forward!

257
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,450
Ice Calamity: Thousand Thorn Blizzard!

258
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,580
Pierce through!

259
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,540
That's the best you can do?

260
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,160
No...

261
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,370
Awaken.

262
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,290
He can use the same astral art
as Lady Alice?! Who are you?!

263
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,750
This is the astral swords' power, not mine.

264
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,120
Ice Blossom.

265
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,500
It's an impenetrable shield. You should give up.

266
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,580
Give up?

267
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,790
If I give up here,
who'll put a stop to this war?!

268
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,910
Vines!

269
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,950
Lady Alice stepped back?

270
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,870
So persistent. Surrender or fall!

271
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,450
Why don't you retreat instead?!

272
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,870
I will not retreat until I defeat
the Empire and unite the world.

273
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,830
Unite the world?

274
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,790
An everlasting peace.
No invasion, no persecution...

275
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:49,200
That is what I,
heir to the Nebulis Sovereignty, Aliceliese--

276
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,290
Y-You okay?

277
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,000
Y-Yes, thank you.

278
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,950
Wait, wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what
do you think you're doing?!

279
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,160
It was reflex...

280
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,870
Iska!

281
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,120
Rin, we shall retreat.

282
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,330
B-But Lady Alice?!

283
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,450
Iska, was it? Do not think
you will get so lucky next time.

284
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,120
Iska!

285
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,830
I'm so glad you're safe!

286
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,870
You had me worried!

287
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,200
Are you okay? Are you injured?

288
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,660
Hugging a possibly injured subordinate
might not be a good idea...

289
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,500
Oh, sorry!

290
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,120
Hey, Jhin. Is this really from an astral art?

291
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,000
The rumors were true. Looks like she's
an extraordinary astral mage.

292
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,790
The ice made it all the way near
our rendezvous point on the frontlines.

293
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,080
Lady Alice, have you been
bathing this whole time?

294
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,410
Let's get out of the bath.

295
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,160
If I give up here,
who'll put a stop to this war?!

296
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,410
Ugh, this isn't doing me any good!

297
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,950
I need a change of scenery!

298
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,540
Lady Alice?

299
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,500
Hey, Rin, look.

300
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,370
"Tragic love of female knight Beatrix."

301
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,080
You want to go to the opera house
in Neutral City again?

302
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,120
Good bye, Beatrix. I cannot be with you.

303
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,120
Oh, Beatrix! To fall in love
with an enemy knight...

304
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,040
♬ Good bye, Azel. ♬

305
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,040
A forbidden love that will never bear fruit,
no matter how strong the love.

306
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,540
How can there be such pained love?

307
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,540
♬ When we meet again, it will not be in
a church like tonight, but on a battlefield. ♬

308
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,750
Azel, you're such an idiot... How could you...

309
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,950
Shhh, please keep it down.

310
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,870
Where is your handkerchief?

311
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,000
It's already soaking wet.

312
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,160
Um, why don't you take this?

313
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,830
Huh? Thank you so much.

314
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,750
Um, I apologize for getting
your handkerchief wet.

315
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,870
I would like to pay for it.

316
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,000
